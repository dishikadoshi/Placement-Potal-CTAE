## ⚙️ Local Setup Guide

Follow these steps to run the portal on your local machine:

### 1. Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Optional, for local development without Docker).

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the **backend** directory:
```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
JWT_LIFETIME=1d
CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUD_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_key
CLOUD_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_secret
```

Create a `.env` file in the **root** directory (for Docker):
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
```

### 3. Run with Docker (Recommended)
From the root directory, run:
```powershell
docker-compose up --build
```
The application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:5173`
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`

### 4. Default Admin Credentials
*Contact the development team for the initial administrator login credentials to access the analytics and management dashboards.*

## 🔒 Security & Optimization
- **SPA Routing**: Configured via Nginx `try_files` to prevent 404s on page refresh.
- **Data Integrity**: Automated sync utilities ensure that legacy data matches new placement tracking schemas.
- **Constraint Enforcement**: API-level validation prevents "Double Counting" and "Multiple On-Campus Offer" violations.
